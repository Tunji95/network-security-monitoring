# network-security-monitoring
## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Snort (IDS/IPS)

## Objectives
- Capture live network traffic
- Detect and analyze anomalies
- Simulate and log intrusion attempts

## Steps Taken
1. Configured Snort IDS rules to detect common attack signatures
2. Used Wireshark to capture live traffic and analyze anomalies
3. Simulated brute-force attempts to trigger Snort alerts
4. Logged incidents and correlated findings

## Sample Output
- `snort_alerts.txt` (example triggered alerts)
- `wireshark_capture.png` (traffic analysis screenshot)

## Lessons Learned
- How IDS systems detect malicious traffic
- Difference between false positives and true alerts
- Importance of continuous monitoring
